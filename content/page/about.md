Hi, I'm Pedro and I'm based in Portugal.

I'm an experienced software developer & team leader and in this blog I'll be writing my notes on everything I learn in my journey as programmer.
I hope that they are also helpful for you.

If you want to get in contact with me or if there is a specific subject that you want me to write about please send me an e-mail to pedro@programmerjourney.com.
