Hi, I'm Pedro and I'm based in Portugal where I work remotely from my home office.

I'm an experienced software developer & team leader and in this blog I'll be writing my notes on everything I learn in my journey as a programmer.
I hope that they are also helpful for you.

I've started my programming career with PL/SQL and Oracle database. 
Some years later I moved to the .NET stack (C# and Razor) and I also develop some projects with Javascript front-end frameworks such as Angular and React.

If you want to get in contact with me or if there is a specific subject that you want me to write about please send me an e-mail to pedro@programmerjourney.com.
