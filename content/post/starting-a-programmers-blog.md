I've been thinking about starting my programmer's blog for 3 years now and I finally decided to go for it.

Here are the reasons why I have started it and why you should do it too!

# Do programmers need a blog? Yes!
A programming blog is a portfolio for programmers. 

If you were a designer, an artist or a model you would have for sure a portfolio where you could show your work to the world, your accomplishments, what you are really capable of doing. 

So, how can you do it as a programmer? If you are a front-end developer you could have a portfolio but having a blog would be much more complete. If you are a back-end developer or a DBA then the best way to show your work is by writing a blog and sharing your knowledge to the world.

# I'm afraid of what others will think about me. What if I write something wrong?
No one is perfect and in this industry we will learn new stuff everyday.

Imagine that you write something down and there is a better way to do it but you didn't knew. If you are lucky enough, someone will reach out and let you know that. This is a great way for you to learn. And if you don't agree with a comment, it's a nice way to start an healthy and respectful discussion.

Technologies are evolving very very fast, it's very difficult to keep pace with them so I think that you'll be ok as long as you don't write something that you don't believe in and you accept to be corrected by someone else.

I had this concern several times and I finally accepted that it is totally fine to not know everything.

# What did I learned during the last year?
To be honest, I'm not sure... But I should!

I mean, I know that I learned [React](https://reactjs.org/) last year when I had to start a project from scratch with my old team but what did I specifically learned about it? Where are my notes from my learning? If I had them and I had to use React now, it would be much easier to remember it again and to understand what has changed since then.

It has been scientifically proved that the best way to learn something is by doing it and by teaching it. Although my goal here is not to be a 1-on-1 teacher, writing a blog post forces me to do some preparation, to think carefully about the content and to make sure that it's clear to everyone. So, I'll be learning better and at the same time I may be helping you.

# You were stuck and figured something out? Post about it!

How many times does a programmer face a problem, finds the solution and forgets about it a few weeks later? This happened to me too many times. 

> Try to write down everything new that you learn!

Once I was asked to improve a MVP website that used [Knockout.JS](https://knockoutjs.com/) in some parts. I knew what it was but I had never played with it before. When I had to fix a bug in this project, I had to learn the basics, how it worked, which features were being used and after some time I managed to fix the bug. 3 months later when I was asked to create a new feature using this JS Framework I realized that I had to learn everything again because I didn't remember most of what I've learned before. At that time, I thought to myself: *There must be a better way*.

If my notes can be useful for me, why can't they be useful for you too? You may be facing a similar problem and my notes may be able to help you.

Don't be afraid - just write down
