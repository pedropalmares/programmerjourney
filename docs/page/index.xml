      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Pedro and I&amp;rsquo;m based in Portugal where I work remotely from my home office.
I&amp;rsquo;m an experienced software developer &amp;amp; team leader and in this blog I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing my notes on everything I learn in my journey as a programmer. I hope that they are also helpful for you.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started my programming career with PL/SQL and Oracle database. Some years later I moved to the .NET stack (C# and Razor) and I also develop some projects with Javascript front-end frameworks such as Angular and React.</description>
