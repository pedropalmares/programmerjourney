      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about starting my programmer&amp;rsquo;s blog for 3 years now and I finally decided to go for it.
Here are the reasons why I have started it and why you should do it too!

If you were a designer, an artist or a model you would have for sure a portfolio where you could show your work to the world, your accomplishments, what you are really capable of doing.</description>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll guide you in how to create a simple blog site using Hugo as a static site generator and Github Pages to host it. This solution is free but I suggest that you buy your own domain which is around $10/year!
