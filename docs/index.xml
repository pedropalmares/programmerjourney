      <description>If you have been programming with Razor Pages on ASP.NET Core 3.0 you know that restarting your application every time you make a change is not very productive.
By default, your changes are not refreshed automatically and you need to restart your application. Let me show you how to change this behavior.
Add required Nuget package You need to add the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation Nuget to your project.
Edit project file This Nuget should be only referenced when you are running your application in Debug mode.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about starting my programmer&amp;rsquo;s blog for 3 years now and I finally decided to go for it.
Here are the reasons why I have started it and why you should do it too!
Do programmers need a blog? Yes! A programming blog is a portfolio for programmers.
If you were a designer, an artist or a model you would have for sure a portfolio where you could show your work to the world, your accomplishments, what you are really capable of doing.</description>

      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m Pedro and I&amp;rsquo;m based in Portugal where I work remotely from my home office.
I&amp;rsquo;m an experienced software developer &amp;amp; team leader and in this blog I&amp;rsquo;ll be writing my notes on everything I learn in my journey as a programmer. I hope that they are also helpful for you.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started my programming career with PL/SQL and Oracle database. Some years later I moved to the .NET stack (C# and Razor) and I also develop some projects with Javascript front-end frameworks like Angular and React.</description>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll guide you in how to create a simple blog site using Hugo as a static site generator and Github Pages to host it. This solution is free but I suggest that you buy your own domain which is around $10/year!

After installation is complete run hugo new site MyBlog:</description>
