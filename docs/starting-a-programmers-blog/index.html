    <p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking about starting my programmer&rsquo;s blog for 3 years now and I finally decided to go for it.</p>
<p>Here are the reasons why I have started it and why you should do it too!</p>
<h1 id="do-programmers-need-a-blog-yes">Do programmers need a blog? Yes!</h1>
<p>A programming blog is a portfolio for programmers.</p>
<p>If you were a designer, an artist or a model you would have for sure a portfolio where you could show your work to the world, your accomplishments, what you are really capable of doing.</p>
<p>So, how can you do it as a programmer? If you are a front-end developer you could have a portfolio but having a blog would be much more complete. If you are a back-end developer or a DBA then the best way to show your work is by writing a blog and sharing your knowledge to the world.</p>
<h1 id="im-afraid-of-what-others-will-think-about-me-what-if-i-write-something-wrong">I&rsquo;m afraid of what others will think about me. What if I write something wrong?</h1>
<p>No one is perfect and in this industry we will learn new stuff everyday.</p>
<p>Imagine that you write something down and there is a better way to do it but you didn&rsquo;t knew. If you are lucky enough, someone will reach out and let you know that. This is a great way for you to learn. And if you don&rsquo;t agree with a comment, it&rsquo;s a nice way to start an healthy and respectful discussion.</p>
<p>Technologies are evolving very very fast, it&rsquo;s very difficult to keep pace with them so I think that you&rsquo;ll be ok as long as you don&rsquo;t write something that you don&rsquo;t believe in and you accept to be corrected by someone else.</p>
<p>I had this concern several times and I finally accepted that it is totally fine to not know everything.</p>
<h1 id="what-did-i-learned-during-the-last-year">What did I learned during the last year?</h1>
<p>To be honest, I&rsquo;m not sure&hellip; But I should!</p>
<p>I mean, I know that I learned <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> last year when I had to start a project from scratch with my old team but what did I specifically learned about it? Where are my notes from my learning? If I had them and I had to use React now, it would be much easier to remember it again and to understand what has changed since then.</p>
<p>It has been scientifically proved that the best way to learn something is by doing it and by teaching it. Although my goal here is not to be a 1-on-1 teacher, writing a blog post forces me to do some preparation, to think carefully about the content and to make sure that it&rsquo;s clear to everyone. So, I&rsquo;ll be learning better and at the same time I may be helping you.</p>
<h1 id="you-were-stuck-and-figured-something-out-post-about-it">You were stuck and figured something out? Post about it!</h1>
<p>How many times does a programmer face a problem, finds the solution and forgets about it a few weeks later? This happened to me too many times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Try to write down everything new that you learn!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once I was asked to improve a MVP website that used <a href="https://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout.JS</a> in some parts. I knew what it was but I had never played with it before. When I had to fix a bug in this project, I had to learn the basics, how it worked, which features were being used and after some time I managed to fix the bug. 3 months later when I was asked to create a new feature using this JS Framework I realized that I had to learn everything again because I didn&rsquo;t remember most of what I&rsquo;ve learned before. At that time, I thought to myself: <em>There must be a better way</em>.</p>
<p>If my notes can be useful for me, why can&rsquo;t they be useful for you too? You may be facing a similar problem and my notes may be able to help you.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be afraid - just write down</p>
