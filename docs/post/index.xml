      <description>If you have been programming with Razor Pages on ASP.NET Core 3.0 you know that restarting your application every time you make a change is not very productive.
By default, your changes are not refreshed automatically and you need to restart your application. Let me show you how to change this behavior.
Add required Nuget package You need to add the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor.RuntimeCompilation Nuget to your project.
Edit project file This Nuget should be only referenced when you are running your application in Debug mode.</description>

      <description>In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll guide you in how to create a simple blog site using Hugo as a static site generator and Github Pages to host it. This solution is free but I suggest that you buy your own domain which is around $10/year!
